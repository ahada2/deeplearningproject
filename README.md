# deeplearningproject
The most interesting part of this project is a wide variety of food items when it comes to food, 
e.g., soup, cake, salad and their variants. Also, the same food item may not look the same depending on different viewpoints, 
lighting conditions, etc. First, a robust CNN-based food item recognition will be developed from the collected labeled dataset, 
then calorie count prediction will be integrated to the system. Finally, we will integrate this recognition system with a mobile app.
